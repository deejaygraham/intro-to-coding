# Micro:bit

1 hour

This is a relatively new hardware platform - a tiny board (a bit like the raspberry pi) but
with bluetooth, compass, tiny display, accelerometer.

Unlike Scratch, which is almost entirely visual, and sonic-pi which is exclusively music focussed, programming the microbit is edging further along the road towards "real" programming using a text-based language called Micro Python.

We will try running some simple programs and a few games and look at how this text based language is different from the visual ones we've been looking at up to now.

Where Scratch hid a lot of complexity behind snap together lego pieces, we
are going to be writing closer to actual instructions. Where Scratch was interpreting our commands
"live" and we could make changes that were instantly reflected in the behaviour of the program,
Micro Python is a compiled language and follows a different lifecycle. We write code in text,
we send the code down to the device where it is compiled into it's own internal representation,
then the program executes. This is faster to run and only needs to be downloaded once for each
version, but it's not as reactive and live as Scratch.
