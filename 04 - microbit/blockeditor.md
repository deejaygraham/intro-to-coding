Choose the Microsoft Block Editor - which works in the browser and is very similar to
scratch.

Just like in Scratch, we have a list of commands on the left, a work area in the middle,
and an emulator on the right so we can test our programs out on. We can control
the program using the buttons at the top.



Let's do something really simple. Lets turn on all the lights on the device, wait
a second then turn them off again. And repeat.

So we'll grab a light control from the left:

Turn on a pretty pattern by clicking some of the 5x5 grid and test it out using the
play button. You should see the output happening on the right hand side.

Now let's wait for a few seconds then turn the lights off again. We go to the basic
section again and drag on a pause block. Let's click in the box and change the 100 to 500
(half a second).

Now add in a clear screen button and another wait.

That only works once but we can try running it in a loop, so we can go to the
loops section and drag on a loop. When we bring the two pieces together, our current
program block fits nicely into the loop block. Run again and we can see the lights flash.

There are lots of other pieces we can use - maths, led , variables - all very similar to scratch.

Nice thing about the microbit is that it is so friendly and easy to get going.

If you want to run on an actual device you can't run it from the browser, you need to
download a file and send it to the actual device.

Let's see some code that matches the blinky light program. Here I am trying to
turn all lights on and flash them. I can play with the lights to get them doing other things.

Turn it on as a road sign -> blinking on and off.
