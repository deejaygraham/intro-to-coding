We don't need a computer or any electronics to have a wonderful time doing programming. The computer is good a repeating instructions very, very quickly and is best thought of as a tool that extends what you personally are capable of.

Beginning coders need to experience a wide range of problems and to experiment in solving them using different strategies. The process is something like planning a strategy, designing a solution, writing the solution. Running the solution then reflecting on their solution and comparing their results with others. As with most other subjects, the process by which you arrive at a solution is more important than finding the right answer.
