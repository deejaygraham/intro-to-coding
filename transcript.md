# Intro to Coding

## Welcome

15 minutes

Hi, welcome to this introductory session on coding. My name is Derek Graham and I am a principal developer at Sage. I've spent the last 25 years developing software for lots of different industries, products and worked in lots of different areas - consulting, managing teams and software departments, and sometimes writing code.

I know for this session you all know each other, but to
get a sense of everyone else's current experience and expectations, can we go around the room and just say who you are, what your experience is (if any) and what you hope to get out of this afternoon.

My vision for this afternoon is to bring you up to date on the last 200 years of computing history and why we are where we are today, talk about making first steps into learning about computer science, we'll take a look at some of the best languages for learners available at the moment and I hope to give you lots of ideas for how to teach this subject when you get back to school.

I don't want to spend any longer than necessary talking today, what I would like is to explain some things, have you tinker and explore and feel comfortable enough that you aren't just following a list of instructions but will begin to understand what it's all about.

Danny Hillis described what computer programmers do as being akin to witchcraft. To be a computer programmer in the 16th century would have seen you burnt at the stake as a witch. We carve special markings onto rocks, speak a special arcane language them and they do what we tell them out in the world. If that's not witchcraft, what is?

We're going to play, break things and put them back together. We'll make lots of mistakes, go down blind alleys and hopefully discover some things. We'll understand what we are doing and figure together how to fix them. By making those mistakes you will get a better understanding of what is going on inside the mind of the computer and if something goes wrong it's not the end of the world, no one will die and no one will be eaten. It is normal for some of this to hurt your head to begin with but struggling with some of these concepts isn't anything to be frightened of but rather embraced. Programming (and understanding what is going on inside a computer) is a skill like any other. You don't have to be special to learn how to do it but it does take a little bit of time to get used to and  

## History

30 minutes

Jacquard Loom 1800 ish

Charles Babbage 1830s

Ada Lovelace 1840s

WW II

Turing's Universal Machine

To the Moon and back

Margaret Hamilton

Mars

Robots are all software controlled. Calculations of trajectories earth -> mars
are all software (very complicated maths).



## Unplugged

1 hour

We don't need a computer or any electronics

Role play
Boolean logic



## Scratch

1 hour

Make the cat walk

What happens when the cat goes off the page

make him

While Loop

Touching edges


Shark game

Robot makes tea

Bounce around screen until found object

Move on to next thing.



## Kodu

10 minutes

MS advanced game platform. Targeted at older children but still drag, drop visual
coding. Only seems to be windows specific and x-box in the US only. No website version available. Similar to
Scratch is approach - blocks drag and drop and connected together but can be used with 3-d graphics for games.

Suited to older children but not that impressive.


## Micro:bit

1 hour

PJ?

New hardware platform - tiny board (a bit like the raspberry pi) but with bluetooth,
 compass, tiny display, accelerometer. Runs a number of different programming languages
 including Micro Python.

 We will try running some simple games and programs and look at how this text based
 languages are different from the visual ones we've been looking at up to now.

 Download from http://codewith.me. connect ot pc with usb cable.

 Type code into window and press flash to download.

 Errors are shown scrolling across the screen on the device.

Download simple game

Show a picture

Show a picture
delay
Show a different picture

Run forever with while true

Run until button pushed

Play with it

Change the picture on an event
accelerometer

Can we clean it up.

Example games:

Magic 8 ball

balancing ball - play and adapt it. Make it more responsive, less responsive.


## Sonic Pi

1 hour

Only if we have enough time.

Simple programming language for music. Play note

Play notes in sequence

Sleep for a delay time.

Changing length of delay with a variable.


Transposing music using variables - root note and intervals

Scales

Major scale definition
Same form of code but with different starting note. same code, different variable.


Repeating patterns

how many times to repeat something



## Review

10 minutes

What have we done today?

history

Running unplugged sessions

Sequencing
algorithms
Selection
Iteration
Variables

How to incorporate some o these things into your lesson plans and have a
appreciation for what it takes to understand what is going on inside the computer.
