# Intro to Coding

## Welcome

If you could do make what would you make?


Hi, welcome to this introductory session on coding.

### Me

My name is Derek Graham and I am a principal developer at Sage. I've spent the last 25 years developing software for lots of different industries, products and worked in lots of different areas - consulting, managing teams and software departments, and sometimes writing code. I have a BSc. in Electronics and Physics and an MSc. in Computer Science.

### Introductions

I know for this session you all know each other, but to get a sense of everyone else's current experience and expectations, can we go around the room and just say who you are, what your experience is (if any) and what you hope to get out of this afternoon?

### My Vision

My vision for this afternoon is to bring you up to date on the last 200 years of computing history and why we are where we are today. To talk about making first steps into learning about computer science, we'll take a look at some of the best languages for new learners available at the moment and I hope to give you lots of ideas for how to teach this subject when you get back to school.

I don't want to spend any longer than necessary talking today, what I would like is to explain some things, then have you tinker and explore enough to feel comfortable that you aren't just following a list of instructions but beginning to understand what it's all about.

We're going to play with some code, make some things, break some things (maybe on purpose and definitely by accident) and put then them back together. We'll make lots of mistakes, go down blind alleys and hopefully discover some stuff. I want you to be fiddling with code, taking it apart to see how it works. You can't break anything and the worst thing that can happen is that we have to scrap your program and type it in again. No one will shout at you for getting something wrong. By making those mistakes you will get a better understanding of what is going on inside the mind of the computer and if something goes wrong it's not the end of the world, no one will die and no one will be eaten. It is normal for some of this to hurt your head to begin with but struggling with some of these concepts isn't anything to be frightened of but rather embraced. Programming (and understanding what is going on inside a computer) is a skill like any other. You don't have to be special to learn how to do it but it does take a little bit of time and effort to get used to applying that skill. Most of the work is going to be inside your head, not typing keys on the keyboard.

It really is about ideas and imagination.

### Computers in Society

Most people's ideas about computers come either from the movies (hackers) or from being made to use awful software in their own work, frequently badly designed software that makes them feel stupid for not knowing how to use it correctly.

Otherwise in popular culture and in the news, it's about building mobile apps or websites or where the latest security leak has happened. For me it's a hugely social and creative outlet and very much about self-expression.

One example of the extreme creative side of coding is Sam Aaron, inventor of sonic pi (later), who writes code in nightclubs all over the world. His code creates music which he performs live in front
club goers who usually can't tell it from a conventional dj.

Programming is a discovery process where we start off knowing nothing about how to approach a problem, and gradual uncover a solution as we work. It's easier than you think and it's also more fun than you think.




### Code, Code Everywhere

Software is now part of how the world works and
The more approachable we feel technology is, the more we play with it, take them apart, tinker with them, the better we a sense of what's possible we have.

Technology affects everything, AI in amazon recommendations, credit card fraud, making movies, medical research (data collection, analysis), medical devices (hearing aids), space exploration, home (Nest, Wifi, DVR), Cars (brakes, steering, engine control), iPods and mobiles

Post Routing, Netflix and Amazon recommendatjions, aeroplanes, cheque processing,financial transactions, cd-players, radio, GPS OS, TIVO, TV, iPod,

All general purpose computers but in special boxes with specific software that is not easy to change.
Often designed not to be changeable. X-Box is a standard windows pc but with good hard drive, good graphics card. fancy box.

Aeroplane is a set of networked computers in a really expensive fancy case.



### Skills

Skills for thinking and communicating.
Social skills, like making a movie - lots of specialised skills coming together with a common objective and working together and communicating. Not about working in your bedroom any more (if it ever was).

Debugging good to confirm you version of reality. Often we think we have said one thing, the other person has understood something totally different

## History

30 minutes

Mozart the dead composer wrote his programs in standard music notation. Thats really what music is,
a written set of instructions for a human and a machine to carry out together. Human plays violin, piano etc. and even though Mozart is now dead, we can
still enjoy his music provided the musicians are able to carry out his instructions to the letter (with some interpretation). No one needs the ghost of the composer to be present to make sure that the "code"
runs.

The history of computers has been the history of humans telling machines what to do. In taking you through an extremely short history, I'd like to call out the contribution of women in this field because it isn't as well represented or understood as it should be.

### Witchcraft

Super-Computer inventor Danny Hillis described what computer programmers do as being akin to witchcraft. We carve special markings onto rocks (silicon chips), speak a special arcane language them (code) and they do what we tell them out in the world (programs). If that's not witchcraft, what is? To be a computer programmer in the 16th century would have seen you burnt at the stake.

### Looms

In the 1800s the Jacquard Loom was one of the first machines that didn't need a human operator, the pattern on the carpet or rug was defined, line by line by a series of cards with holds punched in them to indicate what the design should be. The machine started at the beginning of the stack and worked it's way through each one, line by line until it reached the end and the carpet was complete.

Before this time, machines were really meant as extensions of a person's capability and required their skill to use them. Lots of machines were made after the jacquard loom, still as single purpose devices but with some kind of configuration built into them. But you could not take a windmill and make it into a bakery.

### Babbage

In the 1830s, Charles Babbage had an idea for a more general purpose maths calculation machine. He got cash from parliament to build the machine (millions of pounds) but got bored with it half way through and started another project. It was never fully built and tested until fairly recently.

Despite not having a working machine, Ada Lovelace became the first programmer to write code for a "computer" in the 1840s and the machine didn't even exist!

### War

Lots of history goes by with machines becoming more complex and having more variability and control but they tended to stay in their little silos until WWII

WW II - As the Nazi's had come up with a fiendish plot to encrypt all their data, the good folk of Bletchley Park came together to try and solve the problem using Maths. Very interesting history and not revealed until the 1980s when it came into the daylight from the cover of the official secrets act.

### Turing's Universal Machine
Alan Turing had some thoughts about general purpose computing and posed the idea that you could build a machine that would know how to carry out a very small set of instructions but that the instructions would be structured in a way that they could be combined in lots of ways so that *any* problem could be solved by it if you could work out what the list of instructions should be. Like Babbage, Turing didn't build the computer, that was a team from the Post Office headed by an electrical engineer named Tommy Flowers. They built "Collosus" which was the first proper digital computer and helped with the war.

Lots of other efforts were going on in the US and around the world to solve the same problem so history can be quite hard fought for who has the honour of first "what".

Notable in these is Jean Bartik and the (all female) crew of the ENIAC which was a digital computer used to simulate bullet trajectories for wartime. Prior to this a computer was a person with a calculator using log table to work out trajectories in about a week. The ENIAC could do it before the shell landed.

### Bugs

Things that go wrong with code where we there is an outcome that we don't intend are called bugs. This comes from a time when computers were mostly electrical and electronics writ large, lots of wires,
switches, relays and valves. The first bug was literally an insect that got caught inside the workings
of an early machine and stopped it behaving as the programmers had intended. There is never any relation to rabbits.

### To the Moon and back

One part of JFK's mission to land a man on the moon that often isn't given enough credit is the guidance system that did all the calculations in real time to plot the path from the earth to the moon as both of them were speeding through space, turing around each other and around the sun. The computer that did that had less than 1 millionth the power of your mobile phone and nowhere near as much memory. The team lead on that project was a woman called Margaret Hamilton and the team had huge number of physical challenges that modern programmers just dont face today. One was the need to store the programs and data needed on the flight in memory. The only way to store that much memory at the time was in knitted memory, iron cores were magnetized and slotted into a woven matrix to create a binary image of the program.

### Modern Space !

Space exploration without humans and Mars in particular continues to be an area where software is crucial.  The Mars rover robots are all software controlled and mostly autonomous. Calculations of trajectories earth -> mars are all software (very complicated maths).

and another woman is notable for writing the parachute guidance systems in the recent mars mission where rovers were dropped from parachutes onto surface.

### Now

All this time, the processing of machines has got faster and faster as electronics have improved, got smaller, lighter, more reliable. We've gone from hard wired - physical wiring to switches, punched cards, paper tapes etc. so getting information into the machine and getting results back out has always been a challenge. Graphs drawn, lights, beeps and boops.

Often now the same computer in your DVR or x-box is the same as in your laptop but with different input controls and outputs and different software.

Errors

Also because of turings idea of the general purpose computer being able to work on any problem, there are usually many more ways to write a program. Some will run faster than others, some will use more resources and some bad ones will do both.

Programming languages are the struggle we humans have to tell computers how to work and still be able to reason about what we have written and allow others to understand what we have done and build upon it. Communication with other humans is at least as important.

Time Flies like an arrow
Fruit Flies like a banana

How do we interpret that?


Clear, careful thinking.

How do we represent data. What should the logic be. What should be the flow, what needs to happen first, what should come later?

(Mr Robot)

We don't need a computer or any electronics to have a wonderful time doing programming. The computer is good a repeating instructions very very quickly and is best thought of as a tool that extends what you personally are capable of.

Beginning coders need to experience a wide range of problems and to experiment in solving them using different strategies. The process is something like planning a strategy, designing a solution, writing the solution. Running the solution then reflecting on their solution and comparing their results with others. As with most other subjects, the process by which you arrive at a solution is more important than finding the right answer.

The most important skills for programming are clear, critical thinking, logic, visualization and imagination. Because of that we can do a lot of programming using pencil and paper or
human machines. We start off with a problem and we have to try to understand that problem, it's usually too big to solve all in one go, and be able to break it up into smaller pieces, smaller problems that we can decide if they are the right size or do they have other, smaller problems hidden inside them?
We use metaphors to describe how our program is like the world and how the parts of our program fit together like the parts in the real world.
We also try to create a model of the world that helps to solve the problem in a way that we can represent easily inside our heads and inside the computer. That model only needs to be as good as it needs to be to deal with the problem, it should not model the entire universe in full detail (we will come back to this).

In explaining what we want to do, we often (like english and poetry) can take a long time finding the exact right word and often when we pick the wrong word, others (or computers) can be confused and do the wrong thing or we can ask for the thing we want in the wrong way.

Can you pass me the thing - is it a pencil, pen, table, ?

Often the challenge of programming is saying what you mean in as concise a way as possible. Your programs need to communicate with two different parties - other humans who may reuse and build on your work, and the computer who has to do what you tell it. In this instance, the person acting out the instructions needs to understand what you want them to do.

Link to robot instructions.

Exercises like this are really what you are doing when you are programming "for real" using a computer,
most of the activity is going on in your head. The program comes as a result of your thinking, not something inherent in the machine itself.

Later on when you are writing a program, it can be helpful to adopt these strategies to debug a program that doesn't do what you want. Or mostly does what you want but sometimes goes wrong.

Pencil and paper debugging

Rubber Ducking - explaining the problem and what might be the cause of it.

Using the scientific method

Hypothesis. If that'strue what would we expect - look for ways your theory confirms what you see. Look for ways it contradicts what you see.


Computers are used to working with very exacting language (the kind of rigour you only find in philosophy and mathematics or physics).

Role play



Different robots understand different instructions. Some are mathematical, some are more general,
some know about tea and milk, others can do the same job but need to be told exactly wehre to go
exact positions, exact commands. High level vs low level languages.

Can we divide a chocolate bar into 12 equal pieces. How do we do that? What would be the process for doing it. Can the students write down a process to do it. Can it be generalised to work with any size of bar and any number of pieces? What are the limits? Odd even numbers? Physical size?

We've been talking about algorithms.

What makes a good algorithm. If you are making lunch for yourself, how long it takes could be your only requirement. You might be hungry. If you are a chef trying to feed 1000 people at a banquet and have to coordinate 100 kitchen staff, efficiency and speed might not be the consideration you choose. What if
everyone is wanting the butter or a knife at the same time? Does everyone need their own fridge.

Depending on what you want to achieve, your algorithm might work but take a lot longer or it might not work at all.

Does you algorithm have to change when faced by with the real world. How does it match up. Are there big changes or small changes.


Now we've got some mad programming skillz, lets move on to using a programming language on some actual computers.




## Kodu

10 minutes

MS advanced game platform. Targeted at older children but still drag, drop visual
coding. Only seems to be windows specific and x-box in the US only. No website version available. Similar to
Scratch is approach - blocks drag and drop and connected together but can be used with 3-d graphics for games.

Suited to older children but not that impressive.

Good for getting across idea of interaction, then think about how that could be done in scratch or other language. Talk about what is actually running in the background to make the story work - programming language interpreted by a program, running on an OS, running on a machine. Turtles all the way down.
