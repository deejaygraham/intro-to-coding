# Intro to Coding

## Welcome

If you could make anything at all, what would you make?

Hello and welcome to this introductory session on coding.

### Me

My name is Derek Graham and I am a principal developer at Sage. I've spent the last 25 years developing software for lots of different industries and products and worked in lots of different businesses - consulting, managing teams of software professionals, and sometimes writing code myself. I have a BSc. in Electronics and Physics and an MSc. in Computer Science. I am married with 3 teenagers and a tiny border terrier.

### Introductions

I know for this session you all probably know each other, but to get a sense of everyone else's current experience and expectations, can we go around the room and just say who you are, what your experience is (if any) and what you hope to get out of this afternoon?

How are we all feeling this afternoon? Mad, Sad, Glad.

### My Vision

My vision for this afternoon is to bring you up to date on the last 200 years of computing history and why we are where we are today. To talk about making first steps into learning about computer science, we'll take a look at some of the best languages for new learners available at the moment and I hope to give you lots of ideas for how to teach this subject when you get back to school.

I don't want to spend any longer than necessary talking today, what I would like is to explain some things, then have you tinker and explore enough to feel comfortable that you aren't just following a list of instructions but beginning to understand what it's all about.

We're going to play with some code, make some things, break some things (maybe on purpose and definitely by accident) and put then them back together. We'll make lots of mistakes, go down blind alleys and hopefully discover some stuff. I want you to be fiddling with code, taking it apart to see how it works. You can't break anything and the worst thing that can happen is that we have to scrap your program and type it in again. No one will shout at you for getting something wrong. By making those mistakes you will get a better understanding of what is going on inside the mind of the computer and if something goes wrong it's not the end of the world, no one will die and no one will be eaten. It is normal for some of this to hurt your head to begin with but struggling with some of these concepts isn't anything to be frightened of but rather embraced. Programming (and understanding what is going on inside a computer) is a skill like any other. You don't have to be special to learn how to do it but it does take a little bit of time and effort to get used to applying that skill. Most of the work is going to be inside your head, not typing keys on the keyboard.

It really is about ideas and imagination.



## Minecraft

Can use raspberry pi version of minecraft to run python scripts. Doesn't seem too interesting but a lot of minecraft creatively is moving blocks and levelling areas. Some of this donkey work can be done with code in a lot less time.
