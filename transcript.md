# Intro to Coding

## Welcome

Hi, welcome to this introductory session on coding.

### Me

My name is Derek Graham and I am a principal developer at Sage. I've spent the last 25 years developing software for lots of different industries, products and worked in lots of different areas - consulting, managing teams and software departments, and sometimes writing code. I have a BSc in Electronics and Physics and an MSc in Computer Science.

### Introductions

I know for this session you all know each other, but to get a sense of everyone else's current experience and expectations, can we go around the room and just say who you are, what your experience is (if any) and what you hope to get out of this afternoon?

### My Vision

My vision for this afternoon is to bring you up to date on the last 200 years of computing history and why we are where we are today. To talk about making first steps into learning about computer science, we'll take a look at some of the best languages for new learners available at the moment and I hope to give you lots of ideas for how to teach this subject when you get back to school.

I don't want to spend any longer than necessary talking today, what I would like is to explain some things, then have you tinker and explore enough to feel comfortable that you aren't just following a list of instructions but beginning to understand what it's all about.

We're going to play with some code, make some things, break some things (maybe on purpose and definitely by accident) and put then them back together. We'll make lots of mistakes, go down blind alleys and hopefully discover some stuff. I want you to be fiddling with code, taking it apart to see how it works. You can't break anything and the worst thing that can happen is that we have to scrap your program and type it in again. No one will shout at you for getting something wrong. By making those mistakes you will get a better understanding of what is going on inside the mind of the computer and if something goes wrong it's not the end of the world, no one will die and no one will be eaten. It is normal for some of this to hurt your head to begin with but struggling with some of these concepts isn't anything to be frightened of but rather embraced. Programming (and understanding what is going on inside a computer) is a skill like any other. You don't have to be special to learn how to do it but it does take a little bit of time and effort to get used to applying that skill. Most of the work is going to be inside your head, not typing keys on the keyboard.

### Computers in Society

Most people's ideas about computers come either from the movies (hackers) or from being  are usually portrayed either as being super-high tech


Otherwise it's about building mobile apps or websites. For me it's a hugely creative thing and mostly about self-expression.

Sam Aaron invented sonic pi (later) writes code live in front of a dancing audience in nightclubs all over the world. Hugely technical but something that lots of people wouldn't be able to tell from
a mix by another dj.


The more approachable we feel technology is, the more we play with it, take them apart, tinker with them, the better we a sense of what's possible we have.

### Code, Code Everywhere

Technology affects everything, AI in amazon recommendations, credit card fraud, making movies, medical research (data collection, analysis), medical devices (hearing aids), space exploration, home (Nest, Wifi, DVR), Cars (brakes, steering, engine control), iPods and mobiles

### Skills

Social skills, like making a movie - lots of specialised skills coming together with a common objective and working together and communicating. Not about working in your bedroom any more (if it ever was).

Debugging good to confirm you version of reality. Often we think we have said one thing, the other person has understood something totally different

## History

30 minutes

Mozart, standard music notation - someone wrote instructions for a human and a machine to carry out together. Human plays violin, piano etc. and even though Mozart is now dead, we can
still enjoy his music provided the musicians are able to carry out his instructions to the letter (with some interpretation).

The history of computers has been the history of humans telling machines what to do. Like to call out the contribution of women in this field because it isn't as well represented or understood as it should be.

Computer inventor Danny Hillis described what computer programmers do as being akin to witchcraft. To be a computer programmer in the 16th century would have seen you burnt at the stake as a witch. We carve special markings onto rocks, speak a special arcane language them and they do what we tell them out in the world. If that's not witchcraft, what is?  

Jacquard Loom 1800 ish didn't need a human operator, the pattern on the carpet or rug was defined, line by line by a series of cards with holds punched in them to indicate what the design should be. The machine started at the beginning of the stack and worked it's way through each one, line by line until it reached the end and the carpet was complete.

Before this time, machines were really meant as extensions of a person's capability and required their skill to use them.

Lots of machines were made after the jacquard loom , still as single purpose devices but with some kind of configuration built into them. But you could not take a windmill and make it into a bakery.

Charles Babbage 1830s had an idea for a more general purpose maths calculation machine. He got cash from parliament to build the machine (millions) but got bored with it half way through and started another project. It was never fully built and tested until fairly recently.

Despite not having a working machine, Ada Lovelace became the first programmer to write code for a "computer" in the 1840s and the machine didn't even exist!

Lots of history goes by with machines becoming more complex and having more variability and control but they tended to stay in their little silos until WWII

WW II - As the Nazi's had come up with a fiendish plot to encrypt all their data, the good folk of Bletchley Park came together to try and solve the problem using Maths. Very interesting history and not revealed until the 1980s when it came into the daylight from the cover of the official secrets act.

Turing's Universal Machine
Alan Turing had some thoughts about general purpose computing and posed the idea that you could build a machine that would know how to carry out a very small set of instructions but that the instructions would be structured in a way that they could be combined in lots of ways so that *any* problem could be solved by it if you could work out what the list of instructions should be. Like Babbage, Turing didn't build the computer, that was a team from the Post Office headed by an electrical engineer named Tommy Flowers. They built "Collosus" which was the first proper digital computer and helped with the war.

Lots of other efforts were going on in the US and around the world to solve the same problem so history can be quite hard fought for who has the honour of first "what".

Notable in these is Jean Bartik and the (all female) crew of the ENIAC which was a digital computer used to simulate bullet trajectories for wartime. Prior to this a computer was a person with a calculator using log table to work out trajectories in about a week. The ENIAC could do it before the shell landed.


First Bug


To the Moon and back

Margaret Hamilton lead the team to develop the guidance systems for the Appollo 11 man on the moon project. Show stack of papers. This was with knitted memory and less programming power than is available in your mobile phone today. It was about 1/millionth.

### Space !

Mars

Robots are all software controlled. Calculations of trajectories earth -> mars
are all software (very complicated maths).

and another woman is notable for writing the parachute guidance systems in the recent mars mission where rovers were dropped from parachutes onto surface.

All this time, the processing of machines has got faster and faster as electronics have improved, got smaller, lighter, more reliable. We've gone from hard wired - physical wiring to switches, punched cards, paper tapes etc. so getting information into the machine and getting results back out has always been a challenge. Graphs drawn, lights, beeps and boops.

Often now the same computer in your DVR or x-box is the same as in your laptop but with different input controls and outputs and different software.

Errors

Also because of turings idea of the general purpose computer being able to work on any problem, there are usually many more ways to write a program. Some will run faster than others, some will use more resources and some bad ones will do both.

Programming languages are the struggle we humans have to tell computers how to work and still be able to reason about what we have written and allow others to understand what we have done and build upon it. Communication with other humans is at least as important.

Time Flies like an arrow
Fruit Flies like a banana

How do we interpret that?

## Scratch

1 hour

Scratch is a visual programming language that you can use to make simple programs and games. It is
aimed primarily at children but anyone is able to participate and use it.

There are versions you can download to your machine or you can get started really quickly using the website.

Go to:

http://scratch.mit.edu

and click on the *Create* button

Left hand side is where your program will run. Middle is set of building blocks you can use to
build the program (Scripts). Right hand side is where you drag the blocks and wire them up.

Start and Stop buttons at the top.

### Make the cat walk

Drag move step across to right hand side and click on it with mouse. You should see the cat move a little bit.
Play with changing the value in the box. What happens? What about a negative value?

What do you think will happen?

*Variable*

### Really make it walk

Switch to the control section and drag a repeat block. Slide move into repeat block.
Click on assembled blocks. What happens? Change the repeat value.

Let's make it walk all the way across the screen. Change repeat to a forever loop.
Pull movement block out and drag repeat block out. Drag on the forever loop.

Click on block - will go off screen and you can drag it back on but it will keep trying
to escape!!!

Lets try to correct that. Go to motion blocks and use if on edge, bounce.
Now it's upside down!

Go to info on sprite and change rotation symbol to left right.


*Repetition*
*Predicting Behaviour*

### Bit Rubbish

Now that it's behaving like we want let's try and make it more realistic. For a
cartoon cat.

Costume 1
move 10
Wait 0.25
switch costume 2
move 10
wait 0.25

*Repetition*

Is there a better way - algorithm works but is a better way?  Next Costume. and remove other blocks

Notice when you have a block of blocks, you have to disassemble them from the bottom
can't get rid of the top block on it's own!

Looks better? What about the wait, we can make that zero?

### Events

Let's make it start when we start the game, rather than when we click on it.
What about if we clicked on cat?

### Game

Let's try keeping the mouse moving and if the cat catches up with you, it scores a point!

Add *point towards mouse pointer* at end of blocks.

Follows you around the screen.

How does it catch you?

Test where mouse pointer and cat are.

In sensing, there is a *touching* block. Add If block (from control) and slot in the
touching. See that it will do something inside it when the touching is true?

### Keeping Score

Make Variable from data. Score for this sprite only. Initialise at beginning.
If touching, change score by 1.

### Boolean Logic ???


### Let's end this:

Bit too easy for cat, when score increases, move cat away again. Go to random position.

Now, what about if we get to a big value?

Let's put in a check to say we will end the game when we get to 50? If operators
comparison. Add MaxScore variable. Set it to 50 at start. If Score > MaxScore then end.
Stop this script.

How could we make the game ending better? You win?


### Turtles

Use *Pens* to draw pretty pictures

Draw a square. Draw a triangle, draw more shapes.

Turn n degrees, move forward, turn n degrees



### Resources

Raspberry Pi website has lots of good scratch material that is not RP specific.

https://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/getting-started-with-scratch/


## Kodu

10 minutes

MS advanced game platform. Targeted at older children but still drag, drop visual
coding. Only seems to be windows specific and x-box in the US only. No website version available. Similar to
Scratch is approach - blocks drag and drop and connected together but can be used with 3-d graphics for games.

Suited to older children but not that impressive.


## Micro:bit

1 hour

PJ?

New hardware platform - tiny board (a bit like the raspberry pi) but with bluetooth,
 compass, tiny display, accelerometer. Runs a number of different programming languages
 including Micro Python.

 We will try running some simple games and programs and look at how this text based
 languages are different from the visual ones we've been looking at up to now.

 Download from http://codewith.me. connect ot pc with usb cable.

 Type code into window and press flash to download.

 Errors are shown scrolling across the screen on the device.
