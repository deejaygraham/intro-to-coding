# Intro to Coding

## Welcome

15 minutes

Hi, welcome to this introductory session on coding. My name is Derek Graham and I am a principal developer at Sage. I've spent the last 25 years developing software for lots of different industries, products and worked in lots of different areas - consulting, managing teams and software departments, and sometimes writing code.

I know for this session you all know each other, but to
get a sense of everyone else's current experience and expectations, can we go around the room and just say who you are, what your experience is (if any) and what you hope to get out of this afternoon.

My vision for this afternoon is to bring you up to date on the last 200 years of computing history and why we are where we are today, talk about making first steps into learning about computer science, we'll take a look at some of the best languages for learners available at the moment and I hope to give you lots of ideas for how to teach this subject when you get back to school.

I don't want to spend any longer than necessary talking today, what I would like is to explain some things, have you tinker and explore and feel comfortable enough that you aren't just following a list of instructions but will begin to understand what it's all about.

Danny Hillis described what computer programmers do as being akin to witchcraft. To be a computer programmer in the 16th century would have seen you burnt at the stake as a witch. We carve special markings onto rocks, speak a special arcane language them and they do what we tell them out in the world. If that's not witchcraft, what is?

We're going to play, break things and put them back together. We'll make lots of mistakes, go down blind alleys and hopefully discover some things. We'll understand what we are doing and figure together how to fix them. By making those mistakes you will get a better understanding of what is going on inside the mind of the computer and if something goes wrong it's not the end of the world, no one will die and no one will be eaten. It is normal for some of this to hurt your head to begin with but struggling with some of these concepts isn't anything to be frightened of but rather embraced. Programming (and understanding what is going on inside a computer) is a skill like any other. You don't have to be special to learn how to do it but it does take a little bit of time to get used to and
