Good for getting across idea of interaction, then think about how that could be done in scratch or other language. Talk about what is actually running in the background to make the story work - programming language interpreted by a program, running on an OS, running on a machine. Turtles all the way down.

## Review

10 minutes

What have we done today?

history

Running unplugged sessions

Sequencing
algorithms
Selection
Iteration
Variables

How to incorporate some o these things into your lesson plans and have a
appreciation for what it takes to understand what is going on inside the computer.
